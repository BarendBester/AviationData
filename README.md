# Birdstrike Analysis (Aircraft Wildlife Strikes 1990-2015)

## Overview
This repository contains Python code for analyzing bird strikes on aircraft from 1990 to 2015. The purpose of this analysis is to gain insights into birdstrike incidents and practice Python coding skills.

## Questions Explored
1. **Which part of the aircraft is struck?**
    - Analysis of the 'Aircraft Damage' column to identify affected parts.
    - Additional data may be needed for specific strike locations.

2. **Which species of bird are struck the most?**
    - Examination of the 'Species Name' column to determine the most common species involved in strikes.
    - Visualizations such as bar plots or pie charts may be used.

3. **During which phase are these birds being struck?**
    - Analysis of the 'Phase of Flight' column to identify when strikes occur most frequently.
    - Insights gained can inform preventive measures.
